# danish_police_live

This is the GitHub source version of the Danish Police resource mod for BeamNG.Drive.

The published, game-ready version can be found on the BeamNG repository at: https://www.beamng.com/resources/danish-police-force-w-custom-lights.26372/


This repository primarily serves as version control for the mod, as it has grown to be quite extensive and span over countless files. The BeamNG mod repository was previously used for version control purposes, but since all updates must be approved by a moderator during work-hours, the updates there are infrequent. 


## Features

This mod includes many features and vehicles, including fully JBeam'ed lights and custom vehicle skins, as well as several feature improvements over the base-game models.
